        <p>I am a graduate from BITS, Pilani (B.S.) and University of Colorado Boulder (M.S.). My research work focused on understanding social patterns in online communities via social computing, data mining and knowledge discovery of social interactions, signals and datasets that are byproducts of social media services such as search engines, social network sites, blogs, micro-blogs, wikis. I enjoy working on Distributed Applications, Data Engineering, Storage Systems, Big Data Pipelines and Statistical Machine Learning.</p>
<p>I love music, table tennis, following soccer, reading and traveling. I am a lifelong Arsenal F.C. supporter - Go gooners! </p>
